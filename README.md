# Foundation Data Engineering Course

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide and hands-on resource for mastering the fundamentals of data engineering. It is designed for learners aiming to build a strong foundation in data engineering concepts and practices.

## Course Overview

The course is structured into several modules, each focusing on a critical aspect of data engineering:

- **Extractor**: Tools and techniques for data extraction from various sources.
- **Loader**: Methods for loading data into storage systems.
- **Orchestrator**: Workflow orchestration and automation strategies.
- **fde**: A module dedicated to foundational data engineering practices.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
Foundation-Data-Engineering-Course/
